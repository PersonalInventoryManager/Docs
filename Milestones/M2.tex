\section{Executive Summary}
This milestone, the second of a series, documents the context for a software project proposed by the client, Tim Ekl. This document also keeps track of the use cases involved with the final product which include adding an item, basic searching, advanced searching, sorting search results, viewing item details, editing item details, and generating inventory reports. All of the use cases satisfy a set of features and keep track of actors, basic/alternative flow of events, pre-conditions, post-conditions, extension points, and special requirements. In addition, this document storyboards the final product as well as keep track of the context/data flow diagrams.

\section{Introduction}
TODO: \richard

\section{User Environment}
\begin{itemize}
\item The client uses Chrome whenever possible and prefers that development support Chrome and Firefox browsers.
\item The final product should operate on a Linux server with standard programming languages, programming frameworks, and Apache.  Additional packages can be installed if necessary.
\end{itemize}

\section{Client Background}
Tim Ekl is a Rose-Hulman graduate student who possesses a significant amount of computer hardware.  He plans on using this system to be able to quickly and easily locate the equipment he wants to use.  Tim is an experienced developer and plans on maintaining the system after it is finished.  

\section{Current System}
The client does not have a software solution in place.  Currently, Tim has a primitive categorization system in place which involves labeling boxes and then trying to deduce the location of a desired component.  The current system poses a few issues such as not always allowing him to find his items, i.e. there have been instances where an item was found after capital was spent to replace it.

\section{Use Cases}

\paragraph{Use case syntax}
~\\
Each use case is divided into 8 sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item A “Basic Description” section which gives an overview of what functionality the use case demonstrates.
\item An “Actors” section to describe who or what interacts with the system in the use case.
\item A “Pre-conditions” section which contains the assumptions made, especially those pertaining to the state of the system, prior to the start of the use case.
\item A “Basic Flow of Events” section which details the order of events done by the actor(s) and the system under standard conditions. If a particular step in the basic flow has the possibility of failing to occur successfully, one or more alternative flow listings are presented in brackets following the possibility of failure. Each alternative flow listing matches to an alternative flow in the “Alternative Flow” section. If a basic flow step fails, the alternative flow that is listed with it is followed as the next step.
\item An “Alternative Flow of Events” section which holds each alternative flow listed in the basic flow. Each alternative flow has a unique identifier used to reference it, a short name describing the condition that would cause the alternative flow to be followed, and the order of actions performed by the actor(s) and the system under the flow’s conditions. If an action has the possibility of failing, alternatives to that flow are presented just as they are in the basic flow with a reference to the alternative flow to take.
\item A “Post-conditions” section which contains guarantees on the result of the use case. 
\item An “Extension Points” section which contains references to other use cases which the completion of the current use case might lead into.
