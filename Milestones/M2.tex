\section{Executive Summary}
This milestone, the second of a series, documents the context for a software project proposed by the client, Tim Ekl. This document also keeps track of the use cases involved with the final product which include adding an item, basic searching, advanced searching, sorting search results, viewing item details, editing item details, and generating inventory reports. All of the use cases satisfy a set of features and keep track of actors, basic/alternative flow of events, pre-conditions, post-conditions, and extension points. In addition, this document storyboards the final product as well as keep track of the context/data flow diagrams.  The User Environment, User Needs, Features, Client Background, and the Current System are all information that is inherited from the first milestone.  Finally, this document will also contribute towards the project background and test cases in the fourth milestones, as well as the user interfaces in the third milestone, and usability testing in the fifth milestone.

\section{Introduction}
This document is intended as an aid for both the client (Tim Ekl) and the development team (Team Sriram) in order to maintain a consistent notion of the final product.  In addition to the user environment, user needs, features, client background, and current system (information derived from the first milestone), this documentation also contains all of the intended use cases for the final product which include:  adding an item, basic searching, advanced searching, sorting search results, viewing item details, editing item details, and generating inventory reports.  The use cases are derived from a set of features and consist of a basic description of the functionality, a listing of all the entities that interact with the system, the assumptions of the system state before the basic flow of events, the procedure for a successful run-through, the procedure for alternative run-throughs, the assumptions of the system state after the basic flow of events, and references to extensions of the use case.\\
~\\
In addition to the use cases, the document also contains the context and data flow diagrams for all of the use cases as well as storyboards for most of the use cases.  Information from this document is intended to be carried over towards the project background and the test cases for the fourth milestone.

\section{User Environment}
\begin{itemize}
\item The client uses Chrome [9] whenever possible and prefers that development support Chrome [9] and Firefox [10] browsers.
\item The final product should operate on a Linux server with standard programming languages, programming frameworks, and Apache[11].  Additional packages can be installed if necessary.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Deltas}
After further discussion with the client, it was determined that N1 (describing compatibility with a UNIX architecture) was better considered a constraint on the product rather than a user need.  In addition, N7 was modified to better express the client's need.

\subsection{Deltas}
After review with the client, the features F0 and F4 were reworded in order to better convey the intended functionality and broaden the defined capabilities of the respective features.  In addition, feature F9 was removed since it was deemed to be a constraint rather than a feature of the product.  Feature F1 was split into features F10, F11, F12, and F13 in order to better convey the capabilities of the final product.  Finally, feature F14 was split off of the original feature F0 in order to differentiate the API from the UI.

\section{Client Background}
Tim Ekl is a Rose-Hulman graduate student who possesses a significant amount of computer hardware.  He plans on using this system to be able to quickly and easily locate the equipment he wants to use.  Tim is an experienced developer and plans on maintaining the system after it is finished.  

\section{Current System}
The client does not have a software solution in place.  Currently, Tim has a primitive categorization system in place which involves labeling boxes and then trying to deduce the location of a desired component.  The current system poses a few issues such as not always allowing him to find his items, i.e. there have been instances where an item was found after capital was spent to replace it.

NOTE: F14 (REST API feature) is not mapped to a use case because it is not a visible user feature, but still serves as a function if there is an application that attempts to access the system.

\section{Use Cases}
\label{use_case}

\paragraph{Use case syntax}
~\\
Each use case is divided into 8 sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item A “Basic Description" section which gives an overview of what functionality the use case demonstrates.
\item An "Actors" section to describe who or what interacts with the system in the use case.
\item A "Pre-conditions" section which contains the assumptions made, especially those pertaining to the state of the system, prior to the start of the use case.\label{pre_cond}
\item A "Basic Flow of Events" section which details the order of events done by the actor(s) and the system under standard conditions. If a particular step in the basic flow has the possibility of failing to occur successfully, one or more alternative flow listings are presented in brackets following the possibility of failure. Each alternative flow listing matches to an alternative flow in the "Alternative Flow" section. If a basic flow step fails, the alternative flow that is listed with it is followed as the next step.
\item An "Alternative Flow of Events" section which holds each alternative flow listed in the basic flow. Each alternative flow has a unique identifier used to reference it, a short name describing the condition that would cause the alternative flow to be followed, and the order of actions performed by the actor(s) and the system under the flow's conditions. If an action has the possibility of failing, alternatives to that flow are presented just as they are in the basic flow with a reference to the alternative flow to take.
\item A "Post-conditions" section which contains guarantees on the result of the use case.\label{post_cond}
\item An "Extension Points" section which contains references to other use cases which the completion of the current use case might lead into.

\section{Index and Glossary}
\textbf{Assigned to}: Developer ultimately responsible for the implementation of a feature (\pageref{assigned_to}).\\ \\
\textbf{Context Flow Diagram}: the highest level of the DFD; it shows the entirety of the system. The next level of specification is level 0, followed by level 1, then level 2, and so on (\pageref{cfd}).\\ \\
\textbf{Data Flow Diagram (DFD)}: A diagram that details the data and signals that are passed between different processes and subprocesses of the system. If a particular process is complex enough to warrant it, a separate diagram may be made that shows the subprocesses within that process, and if any of them is sufficiently complex, the repetition of the diagramming at each level can occur as much as is necessary to explain the system in enough detail (\pageref{dfd}).\\ \\
\textbf{Effort}: Expectation of the resources and time consumed for a feature (\pageref{effort}).\\ \\
\textbf{Exact Matching}: Valid search candidates are determined by strict equality with the search input(s) (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Feature}: A system capability that fulfills a user need (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Fuzzy Matching}: Valid search candidates are determined based on similarity to the original search input(s) (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Post-condition}: An expectation of the system's state after the events in a use case occur (\pageref{post_cond}).\\ \\
\textbf{Pre-condition}: An assumption about the state of a system before a use case's events are followed (\pageref{pre_cond}).\\ \\
\textbf{Priority}: Description of how essential a feature is to the project (\pageref{priority}).\\ \\
\textbf{Risk}: Probability that a feature will instigate delays in the project (\pageref{risk}).\\ \\
\textbf{Stability}: Likelihood that the understanding of a feature will change (\pageref{stability}).\\ \\
\textbf{Target Release}: Expected release iteration of a testable feature (\pageref{target_release}).\\ \\
\textbf{Universal Product Code (UPC)}: a specific kind of barcode assign uniquely to each item in the server (\pageref{upc}).\\ \\
\textbf{Use case}: A description of the steps performed by a user and system that leads the user towards a useful outcome (\pageref{use_case}).\\ \\
\textbf{Wildcard Matching}: Valid search candidates are determined based on adherence to the user's given search pattern (\pageref{feature}).
