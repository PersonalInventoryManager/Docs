\section{System Sequence Diagrams}
The system sequence diagrams show how the user and the system interact during the main operations of the system.

\section{Operation Contracts}
The operation contracts show the difference between the state of the system before and after a command.  We choose to show the add item and edit field methods since the system sequence diagrams were not able to provide adequate detail for these operations.

\section{Logical Architecture and Package Diagram}
This diagram shows how the main elements of the system interact with each other.  It also shows which classes are part of the same layer.  The layers represent the three major parts of the system, the user interface, the domain of the system and the technical services that the system employs.

\section{Design Class Diagram}
The design class diagram shows the relationships the classes in the system have with each other.  It also shows the attributes each class has and the operations that each class can perform.

\section{Interaction Diagrams}
Interaction diagrams show how objects interact through messages.  For this system, we decided that sequence diagrams were more appropriate as they clearly communicate the order in which each action is performed.
