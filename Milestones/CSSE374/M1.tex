\section{Client Background}
Tim Ekl is a Rose-Hulman graduate student who possesses a significant amount of computer hardware.  He plans on using this system to be able to quickly and easily locate the equipment he wants to use.  Tim is an experienced developer and plans on maintaining the system after it is finished.

\section{Current System}
The client does not have a software solution in place.  Currently, Tim has a primitive categorization system in place which involves labeling boxes and then trying to deduce the location of a desired component.  The current system poses a few issues such as not always allowing him to find his items, i.e. there have been instances where an item was found after capital was spent to replace it.

\section{User/Stakeholder Description}

\subsection{User Profile}
The client will be the main user of the system. While the client is very familiar with sophisticated technologies and software, the final product will be open-source and will be exposed to many more users who will have a broad spectrum of technical proficiency--so the final product will be made with these prospective end users in mind. The client is an accumulator of hardware and disc media, having approximately 1,000 such items which he wants catalogued. Ultimately, identification of the client's items will be based off of a unique identifier, a category, and as many attributes as necessary to describe it.

\subsection{Stakeholder Profiles}

\subsubsection{Stakeholder: Tim Ekl}
\textbf{Role:} Client\\
\textbf{Success:} The final product reasonably satisfies the needs and requirements as defined.\\
\textbf{Failure:} The final product is not easily usable and cannot be extended without major reworking.

\subsubsection{Stakeholder: Team Sriram}
\textbf{Role:} Requirements, Specifications, and Development Team\\
\textbf{Success:} The final product has its requirements defined and prioritized with a satisfactory amount of the high priority features implemented.  The client is able to easily extend and work with the source code provided.\\
\textbf{Failure:} The final product delivered fails to successfully implement the critical features requested by the client.

\subsubsection{Stakeholder: Sriram Mohan}
\textbf{Role:} Class Instructor\\
\textbf{Success:} Team Sriram understood the concepts and processes utilized during the course of the project. The client is satisfied with the final product.\\
\textbf{Failure:} Team Sriram was unable to deduce any concepts or processes discussed during the course. The client is not satisfied with the final product.

\subsection{User Environment}
\begin{itemize}
\item The client uses Chrome whenever possible and prefers that development support Chrome and Firefox browsers.
\item The final product should operate on a Linux server with standard programming languages, programming frameworks, and Apache.  Additional packages can be installed if necessary.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Needs}
NOTE: The unorthodox ids are to preserve the original identification of the needs prior to revisions.  This is intended to help maintain consistency across all versions of the information.\\ \\

Primary - Necessary to the system \\
Secondary - Important to the system \\
Optional - Would be nice to have in the system

\subsection{Alternatives and Competition}
Tim has researched alternative solutions but has not been able to find one that fits his needs.  Alternative systems have been intended for corporate use, are overly complicated, and are designed for large scale use.  Other issues associated with these products include incompatibility with non-Windows environments, excessive cost, and locally restricted access (not accessible through the Internet).  The client has also considered making a system for himself, however he has never had the time to implement it.

\section{Product Overview}

\subsection{Product Perspective}
The software will be an independent system to be hosted on the client's servers.  The product will replace the current solution by electronically keeping track of asset locations. In addition, the software will maintain data associated with each asset.

\subsection{Elevator Statement}
Everyone accumulates items that they currently do not use, but do not want to discard.  Given enough time, a person will accumulate more items than they will be able to consciously track. We propose a web application which will allow for simple and streamlined asset tracking. The software will maintain an organized and systematic inventory which will also keep track of each item's location.

\subsection{Summary of Capabilities}
\begin{tabular}{ | p{4.0in} | p{2.0in} | }
\hline
\textbf{Customer Benefit} & \textbf{Supporting Features}\\
\hline
\hline
Expediently track items based off of specific criteria & F1, F4, F5, F6, F8\\
\hline
View statistics of asset inventory & F4, F7\\
\hline
Keep all data in one place & F0, F2\\
\hline
Access data from anywhere with Internet access & F0\\
\hline
Compatible with the client's current user environment & F9\\
\hline
Change data associated with items & F3\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\begin{itemize}
\item Availability of network/web hosting.
\item Availability of Ruby [2] and Sinatra [3] framework to run the software.
\item Operates on the Unix operating system.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rough Cost Estimate}
Since the solution will be the product of a course project, no monetary capital will be given nor required.  Concerning a time budget, 340 man hours will be invested into the final product (20 hours per week given four team members).

\section{Non-functional Requirements}

\subsection{General}
\begin{itemize}
\item Responsive on the local network.
\item Local/client storage on web browsers using SQLite [5] and Sinatra [3].
\item Allow for easy transfer of inventory data; involves a simple copying, tar'ing, moving, and untar'ing of the directory.
\item Avoid crashing the application or at least handle the crash gracefully; avoid hard server restarts or corruptions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Cucumber [6] is the preferred testing framework. RSpec [7] is recommended if Cucumber [6] is not used.
\item Manually coded unit tests should be used at minimum if no testing framework is utilized.
\end{itemize}

\section{Use Cases}
\label{use_case}

\paragraph{Use case syntax}
~\\
Each use case is divided into 8 sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item A ``Basic Description'' section which gives an overview of what functionality the use case demonstrates.
\item An ``Actors'' section to describe who or what interacts with the system in the use case.
\item A ``Pre-conditions'' section which contains the assumptions made, especially those pertaining to the state of the system, prior to the start of the use case.\label{pre_cond}
\item A ``Basic Flow of Events'' section which details the order of events done by the actor(s) and the system under standard conditions. If a particular step in the basic flow has the possibility of failing to occur successfully, one or more alternative flow listings are presented in brackets following the possibility of failure. Each alternative flow listing matches to an alternative flow in the ``Alternative Flow'' section. If a basic flow step fails, the alternative flow that is listed with it is followed as the next step.
\item An ``Alternative Flow of Events'' section which holds each alternative flow listed in the basic flow. Each alternative flow has a unique identifier used to reference it, a short name describing the condition that would cause the alternative flow to be followed, and the order of actions performed by the actor(s) and the system under the flow's conditions. If an action has the possibility of failing, alternatives to that flow are presented just as they are in the basic flow with a reference to the alternative flow to take.
\item A ``Post-conditions'' section which contains guarantees on the result of the use case.\label{post_cond}
\item An ``Extension Points'' section which contains references to other use cases which the completion of the current use case might lead into.

\section{Usability Requirements}
\label{usability}
\begin{itemize}
\item User should be able to familiarize himself or herself with the software within one hour
\item An online help system / documentation will not be required
\item Since the client is not greatly concerned with the usability of the product, there will be very relaxed criteria concerning this aspect.  As such, if the client has any issues with usability of the product, the client will request the change or implement it on his own time, depending on the constraints of the development team.
\end{itemize}

\section{Performance Requirements}
\label{performance}
NOTE: Any times described in the Performance Requirements are based on the client's machine specifications, which are: Pentium 4 2.8GHz processor with 1.5GB memory.
\begin{itemize}
\item Searches should take no longer than three seconds
\item There should be no noticeable (as judged by the client) difference in search performance (the most complex task) between 10 items and 1000 items
\item There is no tolerance for any system degradation: the system is either fully functional or not functional at all, and there is no need to handle failures.\label{degrad_sys}
\end{itemize}

\section{Reliability Requirements}
\label{reliability}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system should not be down more than once every two months
\item The system repair will be the responsibility of the client after the product is delivered
\item The system must have no data corruption (100\% accuracy)\label{data_corruption}
\item The system will have no more than two bugs per thousand lines of code\label{bug}
\item The system should minimize the number of critical bugs, though there is no defined threshold
\end{itemize}

\section{Supportability Requirements}
\label{support}
\begin{itemize}
\item The system will be able to be supported by open source community and the client
\item The source code needs to be kept clean and easy to understand
\item The source code will follow Ruby coding standards and naming conventions
\item The client should be able to extend the system with features of moderate complexity within four hours; this is an intended effect from following the Ruby coding standards
\item The source code should be as modular as possible in order to simplify extension
\item Adding / modifying an API route should as difficult as adding / modifying a web application feature of equal complexity
\end{itemize}

\section{Hardware and Software Interfaces}\label{interface}
The final product will utilize and / or be compatible with the following software products:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Ruby 1.9.2 [2]

\end{itemize}

\section{Documentation, Installation, Legal, and Licensing Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item The project should be open source, distributed under the BSD license
\item Copyright ownership will be given to the client
\item Installation should only require installing the necessary packages and pulling the code from the Git repository into the web server directory
\item The only documentation necessary is a simple readme as well as comments near complex sections of code
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item The project must be open source
\item The project must be completed within five months
\item The project must be completed without funding from the client
\item The project must utilize REST, not SOAP\label{soap}

\section{Coding Standards}
\begin{itemize}
\item The code will use spaces, not tabs, to indent blocks
\item The code will use indentation increments of two spaces
\item The code will use underscores to separate words in variable names
\item The code will follow any other Ruby coding standards[14]
\item The folder structure for the product will be similar to that of the GasTracker project, a folder structure the client is familiar with
\end{itemize}

\section{Change Control}

\subsection{Receiving Requests}
If the client wishes to change the code, he will notify the team at a meeting.  Otherwise, he will fork the repository, make the changes himself, and submit a pull request.  If information is required for a change, it will be communicated either orally or via e-mail.  There will be no structured template for requesting changes, and more information will be requested if necessary.

\subsection{Managing Change and Source Control}
\begin{itemize}
\item Changes to sections carried over from previous milestones will be noted in a ``Deltas'' section, which has already been implemented in previous milestones
\item Changes to a milestone will be noted using the Git[13] change log
\item When content carried over from a previous milestone is changed, any milestones containing that content will be updated
\item Changes to anything in the repository will be noted with a detailed commit message
\item The source will be kept in a public repository on GitHub[13]
\end{itemize}

\section{Test Cases}
\label{test_case}

\paragraph{Test Case Syntax}
Each test case is divided into three sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item A ``Scenario Matrix'' section which describes each possible combination of flows (both basic and alternative) of a use case.
\item A ``Testing Matrix'' section which identifies distinct test cases defined by what conditions must be present in order to enact an expected result in response to the situation.
\item A ``Test Case to Scenario Matrix'' section which shows the correspondence between scenarios and test cases in order to help ensure completeness and traceability.
\end{itemize}

\section{Index and Glossary}
\textbf{Assigned to}: Developer ultimately responsible for the implementation of a feature (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Bug}: An error in a computer program. A critical bug is a bug that strongly affects important parts of a system (\pageref{bug}).\\ \\
\textbf{Context Flow Diagram}: the highest level of the DFD; it shows the entirety of the system. The next level of specification is level 0, followed by level 1, then level 2, and so on (\pageref{cfd}).\\ \\
\textbf{Data corruption}: Errors in data that introduce unintended changes to the data (\pageref{data_corruption}).\\ \\
\textbf{Data Flow Diagram (DFD)}: A diagram that details the data and signals that are passed between different processes and subprocesses of the system. If a particular process is complex enough to warrant it, a separate diagram may be made that shows the subprocesses within that process, and if any of them is sufficiently complex, the repetition of the diagramming at each level can occur as much as is necessary to explain the system in enough detail (\pageref{dfd}).\\ \\
\textbf{Degraded system}: The system becomes degraded if there are too many queries performed too quickly or if the amount of data needing to be searched through becomes too large. When the system is degraded, it may result in the system ceasing to function and requiring a reboot (\pageref{degrad_sys}).\\ \\
\textbf{Effort}: Expectation of the resources and time consumed for a feature (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Exact Matching}: Valid search candidates are determined by strict equality with the search input(s) (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Feature}: A system capability that fulfills a user need (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Flow}: A particular series of ordered steps through a sequence of events in a use case (\pageref{flow}).\\\clearpage ~\\
\textbf{Fuzzy Matching}: Valid search candidates are determined based on similarity to the original search\\input(s) (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Interface}: A point of interaction between systems, whether hardware or software, that allows the systems to communicate using some protocol (\pageref{interface}).\\ \\
\textbf{Performance}: The speed and efficiency of an operation, program, or system at a set of tasks (\pageref{performance}).\\ \\
\textbf{Post-condition}: An expectation of the system's state after the events in a use case occur (\pageref{post_cond}).\\ \\
\textbf{Pre-condition}: An assumption about the state of a system before a use case's events are followed (\pageref{pre_cond}).\\ \\
\textbf{Priority}: Description of how essential a feature is to the project (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Reliability}: The ability of a system to function in a range of conditions for a period of time without failing to perform its tasks (\pageref{reliability}).\\ \\
\textbf{REST}: Stands for ``Representational state transfer;'' is a style software architecture often used in servers for simplicity and scalability. Amongst other aspects of REST, it is stateless. This means each request sent from the client of the server that uses REST to the server does not require any information from any previous requests. All information required to fulfill the request must be sent with the request (\pageref{rest}).\\ \\
\textbf{Risk}: Probability that a feature will instigate delays in the project (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Scenario}: A possible permutation of a set of flows that lead from one flow to another (\pageref{scenario}).\\ \\
\textbf{SOAP}: Stands for ``Simple Object Access Protocol;'' is a protocol for exchanging structured information across a network (\pageref{soap}).\\ \\
\textbf{Stability}: Likelihood that the understanding of a feature will change (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Supportability}: The ease with which a system can be fixed should it become broken or out of order (\pageref{support}).\\ \\
\textbf{Target Release}: Expected release iteration of a testable feature (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Test Case}: Specifies what the expected result of a series of actions will have in a system (\pageref{test_case}).\\ \\
\textbf{Universal Product Code (UPC)}: a specific kind of barcode assign uniquely to each item in the server (\pageref{upc}).\\ \\
\textbf{Usability}: The ease with which one may use or learn to use a system (\pageref{usability}).\\ \\
\textbf{Use case}: A description of the steps performed by a user and system that leads the user towards a useful outcome (\pageref{use_case}).\\ \\
\textbf{Wildcard Matching}: Valid search candidates are determined based on adherence to the user's given search pattern (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
