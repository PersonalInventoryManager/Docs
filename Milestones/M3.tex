\section{Project Background}

\section{Usability Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item User should be able to familiarize himself or herself with the software within one hour
\item Ask Tim about task times for use cases
\item The client will judge the usability of the program
\item Ask Tim about the existence of an online help system/documentation
\item Ask Tim about what usability standards we will adhere to
\end{itemize}

\section{Performance Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Searches should take no longer than 5 seconds
\item Ask Tim about Throughput and Capacity
\item Ask Tim what should happen, if anything, when the system has been degraded (degradation modes)
\end{itemize}

\section{Reliability Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Availability
\item Mean time between failures
\item Mean time to repair
\item Accuracy
\item Maximum bugs/defect rate
\item Bugs per type
\item Cyclomatic complexity
\end{itemize}

\section{Supportability Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Should be able to be supported by open source community and the client
\item Ask Tim about the effort required to add a function to the software
\item Ask Tim about how API should tie into supportability
\item Ask Tim how easy it should be to repair the software
\end{itemize}

\section{Hardware and Software Interfaces}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ask Tim if there are any hardware interfaces (how much do we need to worry about UPC scanners)
\item The product will be designed for compatibility with Chrome and Firefox browsers
\item The product will utilize SQLite
\end{itemize}

\section{Documentation, Installation, Legal, and Licensing Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ask Tim about what open source license to use
\item Ask Tim about what level of documentation is required
\item Installation should only require installing the necessary packages and putting the code in the web server directory
\item Ask Tim about his standards on commenting in the code
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item The project must be open source
\item The project must be completed within five months
\item The project must be completed without funding from the client
\item The project must utilize REST, not SOAP
\item Develop in Ruby utilizing Sinatra for web framework
\item Accessible via the web.
\end{itemize}
