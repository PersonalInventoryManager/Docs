\section{Executive Summary}
This milestone, the third of a series, documents the context for a software project proposed by the client, Tim Ekl.  Primarily, this document defines and describers the non-functional requirements such as usability, performance, reliability, supportability, hardware/software interfaces, documentation/installation/legal/licensing, and design constraints requirements.  All of  these requirements are necessary to document since their effects are unobvious in the use cases defined in the second milestone.  In addition, this document contains the user interfaces for a variety of situations in order to provide a better way to enforce the usability requirements prescribed by the client.  This document inherits information from the features, needs, and constraints found in the first milestone and will contribute towards the usability report and the interface designs of the fifth and final milestone.

\section{Introduction}
This document is intended to augment the second milestone, which defined the use cases that satisfied the needs and features of the product, by explaining and elaborating on the nonfunctional requirements and features since use cases focus on user experience.  In addition, the nonfunctional requirements will justify the feature defined in the second milestone which was not satisfied by a use case.\\
~\\
This document will define the usability requirements, performance requirements, reliability requirements, supportability requirements, hardware/software interfaces, documentation/installation/legal/licensing requirements, and design constraints requirements--all of which are defined in the glossary.  The information listed is intended to describe behaviors of the system that are inherent in the use case pre-conditions, use case post-conditions, development phase, and post-development phase.\\
~\\
This document inherits information from the first milestone:  needs, features, and constraints.  Furthermore, the information in this document will be utilized in the usability report and the interface designs of the upcoming, fifth milestone.

\section{User Environment}
\begin{itemize}
\item The client uses Chrome [9] whenever possible and prefers that development support Chrome [9] and Firefox [10] browsers.
\item The final product should operate on a Linux server with standard programming languages, programming frameworks, and Apache[11].  Additional packages can be installed if necessary.
\end{itemize}

\section{Client Background}
Tim Ekl is a Rose-Hulman graduate student who possesses a significant amount of computer hardware.  He plans on using this system to be able to quickly and easily locate the equipment he wants to use.  Tim is an experienced developer and plans on maintaining the system after it is finished.  

\section{Current System}
The client does not have a software solution in place.  Currently, Tim has a primitive categorization system in place which involves labeling boxes and then trying to deduce the location of a desired component.  The current system poses a few issues such as not always allowing him to find his items, i.e. there have been instances where an item was found after capital was spent to replace it.

\section{Usability Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item User should be able to familiarize himself or herself with the software within one hour
\item The client will judge the usability of the program
\item An online help system/documentation will not be required
\end{itemize}

\section{Performance Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Searches should take no longer than 3 seconds
\item There should be no noticeable difference in search performance (the most complex task) between 10 items and 1000 items
\item If the system becomes degraded, an error should be thrown or the system should go offline until client can restart it
\end{itemize}

\section{Reliability Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item System should not be down more than once every 2 months
\item System will be repaired when the client gets around to it
\item The system must not have data corruption (100\% accuracy)
\item No more than 2 bugs per thousand lines of code
\item Minimize the number of critical bugs, but they are still allowed
\item Overly complex operations should be split up into several simpler operations
\end{itemize}

\section{Supportability Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Should be able to be supported by open source community and the client
\item The source code needs to be kept clean and easy to understand
\item The source code will follow Ruby coding standards and naming conventions
\item The client should be able to extend the system with features of moderate complexity within four hours; this is an intended effect from following the Ruby coding standards
\item The source code should be as modular as possible in order to simplify extension
\item Adding/modifying an API route should as difficult as adding/modifying a web application feature of equal complexity
\end{itemize}

\section{Hardware and Software Interfaces}
The final product will utilize and/or be compatible with the following software products:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Ruby 1.9.2 [2]
\item Sinatra 1.3.0 [3]
\item Ubuntu 11.04 [4]
\item SQLite 3.7.8 [5]
\item Cucumber 1.1.0 [6]
\item RSpec 2.6.0 [7]
\item DataMapper 1.1.0 [8]
\item Google Chrome 14.0.8 [9]
\item Firefox 7.0.1 [10]
\item Apache 2.2 [11]
\end{itemize}

\section{Documentation, Installation, Legal, and Licensing Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item The project should be open source, distributed under the BSD license
\item Copyright ownership will be given to the client
\item Installation should only require installing the necessary packages and pulling the code from the Git repository into the web server directory
\item Only minimal documentation is required; other than a readme, it is mostly just necessary to document complex sections of code
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
\item The project must be open source
\item The project must be completed within five months
\item The project must be completed without funding from the client
\item The project must utilize REST, not SOAP
\item Develop in Ruby utilizing Sinatra for web framework
\item Accessible via the web.
\end{itemize}

\section{Index and Glossary}
\textbf{Bug}: An error in a computer program. A critical bug is a bug that strongly affects important parts of a system.\\ \\
\textbf{Data corruption}: Errors in data that introduce unintended changes to the data.\\ \\
\textbf{Degraded system}: The system becomes degraded if there are too many queries performed too quickly or if the amount of data needing to be searched through becomes too large. When the system is degraded, it may result in the system ceasing to function and requiring a reboot.\\ \\
\textbf{Interface}: A point of interaction between systems, whether hardware or software, that allows the systems to communicate using some protocol.\\ \\
\textbf{Performance}: The speed and efficiency of an operation, program, or system at a set of tasks.\\ \\
\textbf{Reliability}: The ability of a system to function in a range of conditions for a period of time without failing to perform its tasks.\\ \\
\textbf{REST}: Stands for ``Representational state transfer;'' is a style software architecture often used in servers for simplicity and scalability. Amongst other aspects of REST, it is stateless. This means each request sent from the client of the server that uses REST to the server does not require any information from any previous requests. All information required to fulfill the request must be sent with the request.\\ \\
\textbf{SOAP}: Stands for ``Simple Object Access Protocol;'' is a protocol for exchanging structured information across a network.\\ \\
\textbf{Supportability}: The ease with which a system can be fixed should it become broken or out of order.\\ \\
\textbf{Usability}: The ease with which one may use or learn to use a system.
