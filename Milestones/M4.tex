\section{Executive Summary}
This milestone, the fourth of a series, documents the context for a software project proposed by the client, Tim Ekl.  The primary purpose of this document is to define and establish the coding standards and change control policies that will be maintained throughout the entirety of the development of the product.  In addition, this document will define the test cases that will be covered to assess the robustness of the use cases of the product.  The test cases include scenario matrices to explain the flow of events being tested, testing matrices in order to explain the special conditions for each scenario, and a test-case-to-scenario mapping to designate the test cases to specific scenarios.  This document inherits  the Use-Case-to-Feature Correspondence as well as the Use Cases from the second milestone, as well as the Needs, Features, and Feature-to-Need mappings from the first milestone, and is considered to be fully-developed--though not exempt from change--as an artifact for future software development.

\section{Introduction}
This document is intended to extend the second milestone, which defined the use cases that satisfied the needs and features of the product, by describing the test cases that verify the functionality of the product.  The test cases will contain the scenarios, tests, and test-case-to-scenario mappings.  The scenarios will explain an expected path defined by the basic flow and alternative paths defined in the respective use case.  The tests will describe the characteristics of the relevant input fields or conditions and the expected outcome that will be enacted in response to such.  The test-case-to-scenario matrix describes the scope of the test cases over the scenarios described and help ensure completeness as well as traceability.\\
~\\
In addition, this document will define the coding standards to be used throughout the software implementation process as well as the policy for controlling change--both for software and artifacts.\\
~\\
Finally, this document inherits information from the second milestone:  Use-Case-to-Feature Correspondence and the Use Cases.  Furthermore, the information from this document is to be considered fully-developed--though not exempt from change--as an artifact for future software development.

\section{User Environment}
\begin{itemize}
\item The client uses Chrome [9] whenever possible and prefers that development support Chrome [9] and Firefox [10] browsers.
\item The final product should operate on a Linux server with standard programming languages, programming frameworks, and Apache[11].  Additional packages can be installed if necessary.
\end{itemize}

\section{Client Background}
Tim Ekl is a Rose-Hulman graduate student who possesses a significant amount of computer hardware.  He plans on using this system to be able to quickly and easily locate the equipment he wants to use.  Tim is an experienced developer and plans on maintaining the system after it is finished.  

\section{Current System}
The client does not have a software solution in place.  Currently, Tim has a primitive categorization system in place which involves labeling boxes and then trying to deduce the location of a desired component.  The current system poses a few issues such as not always allowing him to find his items, i.e. there have been instances where an item was found after capital was spent to replace it.

NOTE: F14 (REST API feature) is not mapped to a use case because it is not a visible user feature, but still serves as a function if there is an application that attempts to access the system.

\section{Use Cases}
\label{use_case}

\paragraph{Use case syntax}
~\\
Each use case is divided into 8 sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item A ``Basic Description'' section which gives an overview of what functionality the use case demonstrates.
\item An ``Actors'' section to describe who or what interacts with the system in the use case.
\item A ``Pre-conditions'' section which contains the assumptions made, especially those pertaining to the state of the system, prior to the start of the use case.\label{pre_cond}
\item A ``Basic Flow of Events'' section which details the order of events done by the actor(s) and the system under standard conditions. If a particular step in the basic flow has the possibility of failing to occur successfully, one or more alternative flow listings are presented in brackets following the possibility of failure. Each alternative flow listing matches to an alternative flow in the ``Alternative Flow'' section. If a basic flow step fails, the alternative flow that is listed with it is followed as the next step.
\item An ``Alternative Flow of Events'' section which holds each alternative flow listed in the basic flow. Each alternative flow has a unique identifier used to reference it, a short name describing the condition that would cause the alternative flow to be followed, and the order of actions performed by the actor(s) and the system under the flow's conditions. If an action has the possibility of failing, alternatives to that flow are presented just as they are in the basic flow with a reference to the alternative flow to take.
\item A ``Post-conditions'' section which contains guarantees on the result of the use case.\label{post_cond}
\item An ``Extension Points'' section which contains references to other use cases which the completion of the current use case might lead into.

Each test case is divided into three sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item A ``Scenario Matrix'' section which describes each possible combination of flows (both basic and alternative) of a use case.
\item A ``Testing Matrix'' section which identifies distinct test cases defined by what conditions must be present in order to enact an expected result in response to the situation.
\item A ``Test Case to Scenario Matrix'' section which shows the correspondence between scenarios and test cases in order to help ensure completeness and traceability.


\subsection{Add an Item}

\section{Index and Glossary}
\textbf{Assigned to}: Developer ultimately responsible for the implementation of a feature (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Effort}: Expectation of the resources and time consumed for a feature (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Exact Matching}: Valid search candidates are determined by strict equality with the search input(s) (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Feature}: A system capability that fulfills a user need (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Flow}: A particular series of ordered steps through a sequence of events in a use case (\pageref{flow}).\\ \\
\textbf{Fuzzy Matching}: Valid search candidates are determined based on similarity to the original search input(s) (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Post-condition}: An expectation of the system's state after the events in a use case occur (\pageref{post_cond}).\\ \\
\textbf{Pre-condition}: An assumption about the state of a system before a use case's events are followed (\pageref{pre_cond}).\\ \\
\textbf{Priority}: Description of how essential a feature is to the project (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{REST}: Stands for ``Representational state transfer;'' is a style software architecture often used in servers for simplicity and scalability. Amongst other aspects of REST, it is stateless. This means each request sent from the client of the server that uses REST to the server does not require any information from any previous requests. All information required to fulfill the request must be sent with the request (\pageref{rest}).\\ \\
\textbf{Risk}: Probability that a feature will instigate delays in the project (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Scenario}: A possible permutation of a set of flows that lead from one flow to another (\pageref{scenario}).\\ \\
\textbf{Stability}: Likelihood that the understanding of a feature will change (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Target Release}: Expected release iteration of a testable feature (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
\textbf{Test Case}: Specifies what the expected result of a series of actions will have in a system (\pageref{test_case}).\\ \\
\textbf{Universal Product Code (UPC)}: a specific kind of barcode assign uniquely to each item in the server (\pageref{upc}).\\ \\
\textbf{Use case}: A description of the steps performed by a user and system that leads the user towards a useful outcome (\pageref{use_case}).\\ \\
\textbf{Wildcard Matching}: Valid search candidates are determined based on adherence to the user's given search pattern (\pageref{feature}).\\ \\
